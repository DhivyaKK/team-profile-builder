## Installation

The below packages are necessary to be installed as part of this application to generate a HTML page to present a team profile from the user response to
a collection of questions.

1. Install JEST from commandline in VS code using 'npm install jest'. The JEST package is used to test the JS class files in a Test Driven Development (TDD) framework. Each of the class files can be tested using the command 'npm run test <name of the .js file>'. The output of the command should fetch testcase results all passed or failed based on the validation of the sample test data supplied in the
class files.

2. Install the inquirer module from the commandline in VS code using 'npm install inquirer@6.3.1'. This project uses the version 6.3.1. The inquirer is required to prompt
the user with the pre-defined questions.

3. Run the command 'npm i' to initialise the project and create the package. When it is run for the first time, the command creates a package.json file to install 
required dependencies from the file.

</p>

The application will be invoked by using the following command 'node index.js'. The user is prompted to enter the manager details of the team followed by a list of options to choose from say, Employee / Intern to next add the details to the team. The user can add as many employee/intern details until the Finish option is chosen which will end the prompt and generates a HTML webpage in the ./output folder of the project respository.
